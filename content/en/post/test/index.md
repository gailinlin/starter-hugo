Shanghai on Wednesday released 40 new favorable policies to support the further development of the 2-year-old Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, which is set to become a special economic zone with strong global market influence and competitiveness by 2035.

The new policies will focus on building up a more open industrial system in the Lin-gang Special Area.

According to the central authorities' guidance, Lin-gang will take the lead nationwide to further relax the market entry regulations in finance, value-added telecommunications services, cross-border data transmission, education, medical services, and culture.

The special area also aims to make breakthroughs in key areas like frontier technology industries, new-type international trade, cross-border and offshore finance, and high-end international shipping, said Zhu Zhisong, director of Lin-gang Special Area Administration.
